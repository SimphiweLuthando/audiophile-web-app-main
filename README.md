## My process

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- GIT
- State management(useContext API)
- REACT HOOKS


### What I learned

This was my biggest project using the REACT js library. It helped me master how to use props and components, 
also managed my states using the useContext API and other hooks lke useState and useEffect.

I also honed my SASS skills more where i used mixins, variables, nesting and  patios.

### Continued development

In future projects, I will be focusing more on effective state management and pratice state managers like the REDUX,
write more semantically correct html
